----- Version 0.6

2010/XX/XX

- Updated version of OjAlgo, ParallelColt, UJMP
- Added JBlas to benchmark
- Turned off LU,QR, Cholesky decompositions from runtime performance test.  Not often used directly and
  the functions which use them and are used directory (solve,inv,symm inv) are already included.
- Turned off jscience by default since its weak and taking up room in the plots.
- Flagged all libaries as using native code or not
- For runtime performance plots, libraries can be filtered by using native code or not.
- Added command line tool in jar file for launching other tools
- Change the way the desired runtime of a test and the maximum allowed runtime for a test are handled to make
  processing of larger matrices easier.

----- Version 0.5

2010/02/23

- Updated version of Parallel Colt (fixed bugs discovered with this benchmark)
- Updated EJML and Commons-Math libraries
- SVD overflow no longer creates matrices that have exactly the same singular values.
  They are slightly perturbed from each other.   This was to make a more realistic test scenario.
- Proved HTML tables. Thanks Anders Peterson for the suggestions.
- Changed SVD accuracy so that an input matrix of zero can't be created
- Modified MTJ, Colt, and Parallel COlt benchmarks so that do not overwrite input matrices.
- Modified all runtime benchmark so that everything that can be predeclared is not done so inside of the timing area.
- Can plot runtime results relative to the mean, median, max result now
- Added sanity checks to runtime performance that makes sure the operations are producing meaningful results.
- Changed how Commons-math creates matrices
- Changed which matrices parallel colt uses
- Changes tested operations in colt and parallel colt uses suggestions from Piotr Wendykier 
- Added a converter for runtime results that change it into CSV format
- Added specialized inverse performance test for symmetric positive definite matrices (covariance)
- Added absolute time plots which show how long it takes to perform one operation
- Added ability to resume old results by pointing runtime benchmark at a results directory

----- Version 0.4

2010/01/22

- Can load XML based config files.
- Adjusted OjAlgo benchmark to take in account its caching of previous results
- Updated to the latest version of OjAlgo
- New random seed for each trial in a block
- First stability benchmark

----- Version 0.3

2009/11/29

- Added Colt, Parallel Colt, UJMP, and ojAlgo.
- Refactored benchmark tests into a single class for each library
- computes more metrics. Mean, stdev, median, min, max.
- Dynamically computes the memory for the slave
- Better error recover.
  * Creates an error log where it writes exceptions to instead of throwing an exception.
- Broke solve benchmark up into two tests.  One for square and the other for non-square matrices.
- Slave can exit if a library leaves a stray thread around.
- each library saves its output into its own directory
- To avoid accidental overloading, jars are now loaded at runtime.
  * All benchmarks should be run from ant for now on since IDEs will load everything.
- Detects if a slave is frozen and kills it.
  * Also prints out messages every 60 seconds so it is easy to tell if the master is frozen
- Added benchmark for eigen decomposition for symmetric matrices

----- Version 0.2

2009/11/10

- Added QR decomposition benchmark.
- Truncated partially finished runs to make nicer graphs.

----- Version 0.1

2009/10/26

- First time I bothered keeping track of changes and set the version to 0.1
- Added QR decomposition algorithms to benchmark
- Slave will now output the library's name
