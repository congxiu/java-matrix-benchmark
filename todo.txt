- Add support for commercial libraries
 * Make it so everything will compile even if the library is not present.

- applet for displaying results

- Randomly draw operation and matrix size
 * first do a run through until an exception occurs
 * once max matrix size is known randomly draw
 * only save each trial results in XML
 * terminating conditions. 1) number of trials per op. 2) total computational time per op.

- only plot results if errors don't exist
- use BigDecimal to compute accuracy of libraries
- stability of BigDecimal matrices?

- convert results to excel format

- Create a memory leak test

- Guava StopWatch for timing

- Remove determinant() from standard benchmark

- Reduce size of smallest matrix in stability matrix from 10 to 6
  * That's what people are focusing on for small matrix optimization
- Summary chart for stability
  * Break results down to pass, minor issue, failed
- Switch to gradle?
  * Download libraries when possible
- Fix summary plot by intelligently cropping the tail
- Weights for each operation is based on their theoretical complexity and not the fastest library
- Penalize libraries which fail stability
- Merge runtime and memory interfaces
- Make it easier to add new operations
